Recipe Finder

Description
Recipe Finder is a simple single-page JavaScript application that fetches and displays recipes based on a user's input ingredient. The application interfaces with the Edamam Recipe Search API to fetch recipe data, displaying recipe names, images, and ingredient lists directly on the page.

Installation
To get started with the Recipe Finder, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Usage
Using Recipe Finder is easy:

Locate the search form at the top of the page.
Enter an ingredient of your choice into the text field.
Click the "Search" button or press Enter.
A list of recipes that include your chosen ingredient will be displayed, each with a title, an image, and an ingredient list.
To search again with a different ingredient, first press "Clear" to clear your previous search then enter the new ingredient into the text field and click "Search". The previous results will be replaced by the new ones.
If you wish to clear the results without conducting a new search, click the "Clear" button.
